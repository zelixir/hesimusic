HesiMusic UI

This is a minimal Vue 3 + Vite + Tailwind development scaffold for the HesiMusic project.

Getting started:

1. cd ui
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

Notes:
- The `musicBridge` service is a mock for development. When running inside Android WebView, replace it with a JS bridge that calls native APIs.
